# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and R markdown files (published at RPubs).

For a more visually pleasant experience for browsing the portfolio, check out [mustafaaurakzai.com](http://blueorcasolutions.com)

#### The R portfolio is located [here](http://rpubs.com/mustafaaurakzai/).

_Note: Data used in the projects (accessed under data directory) is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.
